# How To Scott
	
## What is this?
The point of this README is to introduce myself and give you an idea of how I think, how I work and answer some questions you might have about me. This is a living document so it ~~may~~ will change over time as necessary.

## What is this not?
1. This is not going to lay out my expectations of you 
1. This is not going to say how I think any particular project should be run.
1. This is not going to tell you how to do your job.

## Important adidas-related note
This is *unofficial* in regards to adidas standard HR practices. Nothing in this document supercedes or replaces any of our standard performance-management tools (reviews, 90 day plans, MyBest, etc.).

Also, everything here makes no distinction between Internal and External employees. Regardless of internal/external employment type my goal is to treat everyone the same way (and you'd be doing me a huge favour by letting me know when it feels like I'm not).

## Who am I?
I live in Erlangen with my wife (Shannie). I was born and grew up in the Edmonton, Canada area but since the early 2000s I've lived in the USA, the Netherlands, Sweden, and now Germany. I’m a sports fan, comic book geek, video game player, electronics tinkerer, hobbyist athlete and also drink more craft beer than may be necessary.

My technical background is primarily in front end development in the advertising agency industry. I’ve been in web dev since 2001 or so and though I started as a designer I learned two things early on: I _sucked_ at design and I _loved_ coding. Over the last 7-ish years I've transitioned from pure development IC roles into hybrid developer/manager roles and now probably haven't written a releaseable line of code since 2015. My last role before adidas was as a Technical Director in a digital production shop.

In the sense of being a T-shaped person I have broad (but shallower) experience in backend development, CI tools, 2 & 3D animation, video production, project management, and a bunch of other various and sundry technologies.

There is plenty for me to learn from you and I will bring plenty for you to learn from. It’s going to be great!

Whew. More than enough about me. Let’s talk about us.

## What do I care about?

1. People
1. Products
1. Process

...in that order.

## What do I do in regards to you?

1. Attract, hire, and retain world-class talent. That's you, that's why you're reading this.
1. Provide context for the work you're doing.

### "Provide context?"

At any given moment you should be able to look at a task you're doing and know how it fits into the larger overall organizational OKRs, goals, and priorities. This means that if what you're doing feels like pointless busywork or a waste of time then *I* haven't done *my* job correctly in either making sure you understand that context and/or ensuring that you're actually working on something important.

## Communication
I bias heavily towards transparency and candor. You can ask me anything you want and I will answer to the best of my ability. Sometimes I won't be able to speak about something due to confidentiality or other similar concerns but otherwise you will get my honest opinion about whatever you ask. I will never lie to or mislead you. adidas will not ask me to and if they ever did I would not agree to do so.

My own internal ranking for importance/usefulness of communication methods is roughly: in person, Slack, WhatsApp, **giant gap** email **grand-canyon-sized gap** Skype for Business. Note that I didn't list phone calls here: my phone rings so rarely that my immediate assumption when it does is that something is an emergency. I am almost always available on Slack during business hours and I try to respond quickly whenever possible. 

One clear way to *not* get a hold of me is to tag me in a Jira ticket. I receive 100+ Jira notifications most days, relying solely on a tag in an issue to make me aware of something is not going to be a shortcut to awesome.

There are very few things that I will do at adidas that are more important than talking with you if you need to talk to me. Slack me, email me, drop by my desk, grab time in my calendar. If you don’t find time in my calendar, message me and I’ll make time.

Sometimes I like to get some work done on evenings and weekends. Assuming it's not marked as urgent if I message you on the weekend **I don't expect you to respond**. I don't expect you to work outside of core business hours unless something has been planned ahead of time (i.e. a site update on a Saturday). I want you to enjoy your life outside of the office so that you're happy, healthy and focused when you are at adidas.

## Feedback
The importance of feedback to me cannot be overstated. I need feedback. You need feedback. We need to make sure that we are regularly communicating feedback candidly because we can’t make good choices if we don’t understand the actual context of the choice.

My primary goal as your manager is for you to be happy, fulfilled and doing good work. You should never be afraid to provide feedback to me or come to me with any concerns. Your success is my success and it’s in both our best interests to tackle any problems that might be happening for you so that you can move forward.

## One-on-ones (1-1s)
I’m a big believer in the importance of 1-1s. I will always make time for these meetings no matter how crazy my schedule might look (vacation/sick leave times being an obvious exception). 

**These are your meetings**. This is time for you to talk about whatever you want with me and have my undivided attention. That means these meetings will be more productive if you bring topics, concerns or just thoughts. My preference is for these not to be status updates (what you’re currently working on) and more about topics of substance.

I will create a private Slack channel for you to dump topics into so that we have a central place to refer to when we sit down together. If there is something I think is important that we should talk about, I will add it there as well.

For the first few weeks of us getting to know one another, we’re going to meet weekly. The first time we meet will be for an hour and then we’ll switch to half hour meetings in the weeks following. If, after some time, we mutually agree that we should do these less often, we can alter that schedule.

All of that said, if there is something that is urgent that we need to talk about, don’t wait for the next 1-1. **Let me know ASAP.**

## What (I think) I do well

1. Context, not control. I will rarely – if ever – outright _tell_ you what to do.

## What (I think) I don't do well

1. I have been known to take "context, not control" to an extreme and not stepped in to provide more direction when it's been needed.
